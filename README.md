# Project: She Codes News

Project She Codes News is an assignment for the Django module in [She Codes Plus](https://shecodes.com.au/program/plus/) program(2022-2023) by [She Codes Australia](https://shecodes.com.au/). I am immensely grateful to be a part of this fully funded 6 months program for women who'd like to get into the tech industry.

## Process

Starter codes were provided as per last She Codes project, generated from this template below:
[https://github.com/SheCodesAus/plus-django-news-project-template](https://github.com/SheCodesAus/plus-django-news-project-template)

With a lot to digest in 3 weeks, we started with learning how to set up a virtual environment, along with going through ["Writing your first Django app".](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/)
Then bit by bit, we tackled this project and danced around the fire all together.

## Requirements

As seen in the Django_News_Project_Description.pdf file, these are the features I have implemented successfully:

Part 1
Facilitated Feature: Creating a form for adding new stories. Features to implement:
● Order the stories by date.
● Style the form for adding new stories.
● Add a field to the NewsStory model for an image url and use this image url rather than the default
images provided in the starter.

Part 2
Facilitated Feature: Creating a Users app. Features to implement:
● Functional login/logout buttons.
● Account view so authors can see their profile information.
● Create Account functionality, so a new user can sign up to be an author.
● View stories by a particular author.
● Show/Hide the relevant information and buttons based on whether the user is logged in/out (e.g.
should only be able to see the button to create a new story if I am logged in).
● Enable/Disable the relevant features based on whether the user is logged in/out (e.g. should only be
able to create a new story if I am logged in).

Additional Features
● Add the ability to update and delete stories.


Below additional features I have not implemented:
● Add categories to the stories and allow the user to search for stories by category.
● Add the ability to “favourite” stories and see a page with your favourite stories.
Note


## Possible improvements

I felt quite lost(and found, and then lost again) during the last 3 weeks. I think I got stunned with the depth and width of unknown that is Django. Like anything(but especially in programming), there were a lot to learn and apply in a short time-frame. If I started with higher level concepts, and gradually dug deeper rather than try to dig 100 holes simutaneously - I think would have been wiser. It was kind of a chaotic dance learning to Django. I even listened to Django Reinhardt to get closer to it, but succumbed to Jurassic Park sound track. I digress...


## What I learnt

It's okay to not feel in control. It's okay to ask for help.

As per soon-to-be tradition, I want to thank the mentors and my friend Cat(GitHub: @cattrn) for their time and dedication.

Sweet carrots,
